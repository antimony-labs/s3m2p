# Power Circuits Designer

A WebAssembly tool for designing and simulating power electronic circuits.

## Overview
This tool allows for the design and analysis of power circuits directly in the browser. It leverages Rust's performance for circuit simulation.

## Features
- **Circuit Simulation**: (Planned) SPICE-like simulation engine.
- **Component Library**: Access to standard power components.
- **WASM Integration**: Runs locally in the browser.

## Dependencies
- `wasm-bindgen`
- `web-sys`
