Most people name their company after what it does. I named mine after a chemistry joke.

Shivam Bhardwaj → Sb → Antimony (element 51). My parents gave me a periodic table easter egg and I've been waiting 25 years to use it.

So here we are. Antimony Labs. A one-person "lab" run by a guy who thinks naming things is harder than building them.

I also bought the domain **too.foo** because it was available and I have poor impulse control. Turns out it's perfect-everything lives at `something.too.foo`. Solar system? [helios.too.foo](https://helios.too.foo). Wave patterns? [chladni.too.foo](https://chladni.too.foo). Linux tutorials? [ubuntu.too.foo](https://ubuntu.too.foo). This blog? You're on it. Easy to remember, fun to say, and only mildly confusing to type.

## What's This All About?

I'm an engineer who got tired of expensive, bloated software that crashes at the worst possible moments. So I started building my own tools. Then I kept building. Now I have... whatever this is.

**too.foo** is my playground. It's where I experiment with building engineering tools from scratch using Rust, WebAssembly, and a healthy dose of AI assistance.

Yes, AI assistance. I use Claude to help me code. A lot. I'm not pretending to be a one-person army-I'm experimenting with what's possible when you combine human intuition with AI capability. Sometimes it works beautifully. Sometimes I spend three hours debugging something an LLM confidently told me was correct.

That's the experiment.

## What I'm Building

### Tools

- **MCAD** - Mechanical CAD with my own geometry kernel. Still early, but it's mine.
- **ECAD** - PCB design without the Altium price tag.
- **Simulations** - Physics toys. Orbital mechanics. Wave patterns. Things that move on screen and teach me something.

### Learning Platform

Interactive tutorials for the stuff I wish I'd learned better the first time:
- AI/ML fundamentals
- Robotics and SLAM
- Embedded systems (ESP32, Arduino)
- The Linux stuff nobody teaches you

Not videos. Actual simulations you can poke at.

### Hardware (Eventually)

Robots. Embedded systems. Physical things that exist in the real world. Coming soon™.

## The Philosophy

**Build to understand.** I'm not trying to compete with SolidWorks. I'm trying to understand how solid modeling actually works by writing a B-rep kernel myself.

**Minimize dependencies.** Not because I'm a purist, but because debugging someone else's abstraction at 2am is miserable.

**Ship constantly.** Even if it's broken. Especially if it's broken. That's how you learn.

## Why Rust and WASM?

Everything here compiles to WebAssembly and runs in your browser. No downloads. No "works on my machine." Just a URL.

Rust because it's fast, safe, and makes me feel like I know what I'm doing (I don't, but the compiler catches most of my mistakes).

## What's Next

Honestly? I'm figuring it out as I go.

The rough plan:
- More simulation tools
- Better CAD functionality
- Hardware projects documented here
- Tutorials for everything I build

This blog is where I'll document the journey - the wins, the failures, the "why did I think this was a good idea" moments.

If you're into engineering, tinkering, or watching someone build things in public with AI assistance, stick around.

Welcome to Antimony Labs.
