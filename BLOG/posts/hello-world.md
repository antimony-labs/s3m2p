# Welcome to the Blog

This blog is built entirely in **Rust**, compiled to **WebAssembly**, and rendered client-side. No JavaScript frameworks, no server-side rendering - just pure Rust.

## Why Rust for a Blog?

Three reasons:

1. **Performance** - WASM is fast. Really fast.
2. **Type Safety** - Markdown parsing with compile-time guarantees.
3. **Learning** - Because why not?

## What to Expect

Posts here will cover:

- **Robotics** - Algorithms, simulations, hardware projects
- **Rust** - Systems programming, WASM, embedded
- **AI/ML** - From scratch implementations, thoughts on the field
- **Random Thoughts** - Whatever's on my mind

Some posts will be AI-generated (clearly marked). The goal is to experiment with AI-assisted writing while maintaining quality.

## The Tech Stack

```rust
// Core dependencies
pulldown-cmark   // Markdown → HTML
wasm-bindgen     // Rust ↔ JS interop
web-sys          // DOM manipulation
```

The blog engine parses markdown with frontmatter, handles client-side routing, and renders everything in the browser.
