# Summary: Enhanced math and implementation has been added to Lessons 0 and 1.
# For Lessons 2-5, the complete enhanced content is documented in:
# - LESSONS_2_TO_5_ENHANCED.md (comprehensive reference)
# - LESSON1_ENHANCED.txt (template example)
#
# To complete the enhancement:
# 1. Review LESSONS_2_TO_5_ENHANCED.md
# 2. Apply similar patterns to lessons 2-5 in src/lessons.rs
# 3. Each lesson needs:
#    - math_details: LaTeX equations with contextual explanations
#    - implementation: Hardware examples + LLM prompts
#
# Current status:
# ✅ Lesson 0: Complete with odometry math and encoder examples
# ✅ Lesson 1: Complete with complementary filter equations and MPU6050 examples
# ⏳ Lesson 2: Needs Kalman equations and GPS fusion examples
# ⏳ Lesson 3: Needs particle filter math and resampling code
# ⏳ Lesson 4: Needs EKF SLAM with Ouster LiDAR integration
# ⏳ Lesson 5: Needs Graph SLAM optimization and loop closure
